# 🌀 Building My Portfolio with Angular & GSAP  
## Creating a More Interactive Developer Site

### 🎯 Why I Rebuilt My Portfolio
- What was missing from your previous portfolio?
- What kind of "vibe" or interaction did you want?
- Why choose Angular, Tailwind, and GSAP?

### 🧱 The Stack
- Angular 16+ (why it's your framework of choice)
- Tailwind CSS (pros/cons of utility-first styling)
- GSAP for animations (why not just CSS?)

### 🎨 What I Wanted to Build
- Typing animation on the homepage
- Page transition effects
- Project card carousel
- Blog section using Markdown

### 💡 What I Learned
- Insights into working with GSAP (ease, flexibility, quirks)
- Angular animation strategies + component architecture
- Tailwind layout tips or structure takeaways

### 🛠️ Future Plans
- Features still in progress or planned
- Modal project views?
- Improved blog flow?
- Port to static site generator?
